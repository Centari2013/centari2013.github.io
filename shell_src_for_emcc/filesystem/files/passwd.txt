File: /etc/passwd

What is /etc/passwd?
The /etc/passwd file is a critical component of any Unix-like operating system. It stores essential information about all the system's users. Despite its name, it does not actually contain passwords (those are stored securely in /etc/shadow).

Structure of /etc/passwd:
Each line in /etc/passwd represents a user and contains the following fields, separated by colons (:):

    Username: The login name of the user (e.g., root, zaria).
    Password Placeholder: Historically stored encrypted passwords. Modern systems use x or ! to indicate that the actual password is in /etc/shadow.
    User ID (UID): A unique numeric identifier for the user. For example, 0 is reserved for the root user.
    Group ID (GID): The primary group ID associated with the user.
    User Info: A field for optional information, like the user's full name or other details.
    Home Directory: The user's default directory after login.
    Shell: The user's default shell (e.g., /bin/bash or /bin/zsh).

Example of a typical /etc/passwd entry:

zaria:x:1001:1001:Zaria SpicyKneecaps:/home/SpicyKneecaps:/bin/bash

What does each field mean in this example?

    zaria: The username for the account.
    x: The password placeholder (actual password is stored in /etc/shadow).
    1001: The user's UID.
    1001: The user's primary GID.
    Zaria SpicyKneecaps: Optional user info.
    /home/SpicyKneecaps: The home directory for the user.
    /bin/bash: The shell assigned to the user.

Why is it important?
The /etc/passwd file enables the system to manage user accounts, validate user logins, and determine each user's environment after login. It's a foundational element of multi-user systems.

Security Note:
While /etc/passwd is world-readable for system functionality, passwords are no longer stored here for security reasons. Instead, they are stored in the more secure /etc/shadow file, accessible only by administrators.

Fun Fact:
The /etc/passwd file format has remained largely unchanged since its introduction in early Unix systems, highlighting its simplicity and effectiveness.
