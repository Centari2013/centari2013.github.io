File: /bin/ls

What is ls?
The ls command is a tool that lists the contents of a directory. It allows you to see files and subdirectories in your current location or any specified path. Think of it as your file explorer for the terminal.

How does it work?
When you run ls, it reads the specified directory and displays its contents. By default, it only shows file and directory names, but you can customize the output with various options. For example:

    ls -a shows hidden files.
    ls -l displays detailed information like file size, permissions, and timestamps.
    ls -t sorts files by modification time.

Why is it in /bin?
The /bin directory is where essential commands are stored. These are the tools you can rely on, even in minimal system environments. ls is a core utility that helps you navigate your file system efficiently.

Sample Usage:

$ ls
Documents  Downloads  Pictures  README.md

$ ls -l
drwxr-xr-x  5 user group  4096 Jan 22 14:33 Documents
-rw-r--r--  1 user group   512 Jan 22 14:32 README.md

Fun Fact:
The name ls is short for “list.” It's designed to follow the Unix philosophy of creating simple, powerful tools.
