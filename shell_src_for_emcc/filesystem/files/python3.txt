What is Python3?
Python3 is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its readability, simplicity, and versatility. It's widely used in everything from web development to data science, automation, and artificial intelligence.

How to Use Python3
To launch Python3 from the terminal, simply type:

python3

This will start the interactive Python shell, where you can write and execute Python code in real time.

Example:

>>> print("Hello, SpicyOS!")
Hello, SpicyOS!

To exit the Python shell, type:

exit()

Executing Python Files
You can also run Python scripts directly from the terminal:

python3 script_name.py

For example:

python3 hello_world.py
