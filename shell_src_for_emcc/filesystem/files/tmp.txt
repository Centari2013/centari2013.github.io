Directory: /var/tmp

What is /var/tmp?
The /var/tmp directory is a temporary storage location for files that applications or processes may need to keep across system reboots. Unlike the /tmp directory, which is often cleared when the system restarts, files in /var/tmp are meant to persist longer.

What's stored here?

    Temporary Files:
    Applications or processes that require temporary file storage for extended periods use this directory.
    Example:
        Partially downloaded files from software installers.
        Large, temporary working files for media editing or rendering tools.

    Session Data:
    Services that need to resume tasks after a reboot might save session-related files here.

Key Characteristics:

    Longer File Lifespan:
    Unlike /tmp, the system does not automatically clear /var/tmp on reboot. Files remain until manually deleted or cleaned by a maintenance process.

    Shared Access:
    Multiple applications can store their temporary data here. Files created in /var/tmp often have default read-write permissions for the system.

Can I delete files in /var/tmp?
Yes, but be careful.

    Removing files while an application is running might cause errors or unexpected behavior.
    If you're cleaning up disk space, focus on files that haven't been accessed for a while.
    Example:

    find /var/tmp -type f -atime +7 -delete

Best Practices:

    Use /var/tmp for larger or long-term temporary files:
    Applications should use /tmp for short-lived data and /var/tmp for files that need to persist longer.
    Regular Maintenance:
    While the system doesn't clear /var/tmp automatically, you can set up cron jobs to periodically clean it up.

Trivia:
Think of /var/tmp as a “safe house” for temporary files—secure for a while but not meant for long-term living. When in doubt, tidy it up, but leave the currently “occupied” files alone.
